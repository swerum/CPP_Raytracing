# C++ Raytracing
This project was made with the help of the [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) Book. I followed along with the book, writing my own code and checking it against the book's if I needed to. 

Tangents included 
* Backface Culling,
* How Depth of Field works in actual cameras and the difference between focal length and focus distance
* Left-handed vs. Right-handed coordinate systems
* Why on earth would I want inheritance to not be public, C++?

Here is my own ray-traced rendition of the books cover image, here converted from a ppm to a png:
